## Roomba game

Feel free to clone this repo and try it out. To run the index.js, you will have to install node, and save index.js and the txt files to a folder on your computer. Using a mac on terminal, run: `node index.js`

There are several txt files. You only need one. They are to test the roomba with different directions. To test with the different .txt files, change 'input.txt' on line 7 to a different text file, such as 'input1.txt'.

This program expects valid inputs.
